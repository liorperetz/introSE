As part of my studies at the Lev Academic Center we developed a graphical library based on Ray Tracing algorithms in Java.

To enhance the image we used a beam of rays to create an effect of realistic reflection from glossy surfaces. 
As part of the running time improvements we used multithreading and Adaptive Supersampling algorithm.

You can find examples of images created using the library inside the Images folder.
